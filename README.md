# Pong
Small class project I built for a Game Development class in PyGame. 
Building old games from scratch we had to make Pong with a twist. I chose to make Pong with guns. 
The goal is to play normal Pong but to rely heavily on shooting the ball to change its trajectory and score points. 
But you have to be careful, if you shoot the CPU paddle it may choose to parry the bullet back at you. I might come back to this and have bullets slow the player and CPU down.
